# DAT-ASS
This is the repository of team diversity. We created a security system called the Direct Access Transmission 
for Automated Security Systems. The reason why it is called as such is because it is a highly little autonomous 
security system that needs very little installation. It actually used a variety of sensors and calculated whether 
someone was in your home, then wrote this information to a personal twitter account that is connected and giving 
toast notifications to an andriod app.
